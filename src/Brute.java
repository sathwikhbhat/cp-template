/*
    BRUTE FORCE TEMPLATE NOTES

    Purpose:
    - Brute force is the reference solution
    - It must be simple and obviously correct
    - Performance does NOT matter (within small limits)

    Input handling:
    - Read input exactly as the problem states
    - Use the same input format as the main solution

    Output rules:
    - Output must follow the same format as the solution
    - For multiple valid answers, output ANY correct one
    - Brute output is used by the validator as ground truth

    Guidelines:
    - Prefer clarity to optimization
    - Use recursion / loops freely
    - Avoid clever tricks
    - Small constraints only

    Failure rule:
    - If the brute is wrong, stress testing is meaningless
